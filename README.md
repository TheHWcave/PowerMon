# PowerMon
Scripts and wiring for connecting an INA219 current monitor to a Raspberry Pi

see my YouTube channel TheHWcave for more information what this is about. 

There is a new Powermon guide document PDF which explains the basic usage, the menus
and how to install it

The development is broken into different parts (part1, part2...) each exploring 
different aspects and design options

Each new part supersedes all previous ones Part 4.2 is the latest version
