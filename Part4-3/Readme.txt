Updates to Powermon source code.
- I investigated if shunt voltage should/could be calibrated. This led to a complete rewrite of the calibration routine.
  Instead of current, the calibration now uses shunt voltage and calibrates the shunt resistor (if needed). This simplifies 
  calibration especially if several shunt resistors are in use as shunt voltage needs to be calibrated only once. 
- The utility program to generate CALDATA has changed to match the new format. 
- Stricktly speaking, the CALREG and CURLSB values generated by the utility are no longer needed because Powermon does not use
  the INA calculated current or power values anymore and the only purpose of CALREG and CURLSB are to allow the INA219 chip to 
  calculate these values. I decided to keep the setup values for the INA219 chip in the CALDATA because both INA current and 
  power values are included in the SNAPSHOT data and without proper setup, they would always be zero (or completely wrong). Also 
  who knows it there are any side effects in the chip when these values are not setup. The data sheet says it should work and
  the corresponding registers will always return zero, but the same data sheet has been wrong before..
